# Minimal MEAN App

### Techs Used  

1. MongoDB
2. ExpressJS
3. AngularJS
4. NodeJS

### The Road Ahead  (in order of priority)

1. Create a Medium Post explaining the code.
2. Create a build using webpack, to make this production ready.
3. Upgrade AngularJS from 1.4.x to 1.7.x
4. Move to ES6 standards.

### Running the app on your local

1. MongoDB must be running on localhost at 27017, else code relating to Mongo connection needs to be changed.
2. Inside build/, there's a seedDB.js which should be exectured to create a first default user.
3. Move to project home folder to install dependencies, NodeJS shoud be more than 8.x; "npm ci" to install all dependencies.
4. Move to "http://localhost:3000",

### Why this app?  

I couldn't find a full scale app anywhere on the internet, so decided to work it out myself.
