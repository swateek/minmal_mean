# Minimal MEAN App

### Techs Used  

1. MongoDB
2. ExpressJS
3. AngularJS
4. NodeJS

### The Road Ahead  (in order of priority)

1. Create a Medium Post explaining the code.
2. Create a build using webpack, to make this production ready.
3. Upgrade AngularJS from 1.4.x to 1.7.x

### Why this app?  

I couldn't find a full scale app anywhere on the internet, so decided to work it out myself.
